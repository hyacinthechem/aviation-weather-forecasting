## Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for Weather forecasting in Aviation 


This is a summer paper that entails research on deep learning approaches to improve current weather forecasting tools used at airports such as current weather observations ( METARs ) and forecasts ( TAFs ). 

This was done under the supervision of a professor that provides resources and guidance on the topic.


### Literature Review: Past work done in the field

Created an Annotated Bibliography that reviews some of the imperative work done in the field of weather forecasting for aerodromes/airports.


### Dataset Identification

Utilises 5 years of past METAR reports every 30 minutes at NZWN ( Wellington International Airport ) compiled in a CSV format.
